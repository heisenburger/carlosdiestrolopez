I specialize in crafting readable, scalable code and processes, tailored to each use case while prioritizing
simplicity. I like to challenge the status quo while understanding its foundations. I enjoy researching trade-offs and collaborating with teammates to reach optimal solutions, as well as offering proactive support to others in times of difficulty.
